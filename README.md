# sc_RNA_seq
I created several models for classification of cell types of mice brain using publicly available data of single cell RNA sequences.

Data taken from [brainimagelibrary](https://download.brainimagelibrary.org/cf/1c/cf1c1a431ef8d021/processed_data/)

Final model based on small full-stacked neural network achieves 99.8% accuracy on both validation and test parts of the dataset.
